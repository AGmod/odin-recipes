        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a burger recipe to make my personal favorite entree to make at home.</p>
        <p>It will be so delicious you will rather make it at home instead of ordering from a restaurant!</p>

        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sesame seed bun</li>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <li>Tomato</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>American Cheese</li>
            <li>Ground beef or beef patty</li>
            <li>Ketchup</li>
            <li>Mustard</li>
            <li>Mayo</li>
            <li>The Blend seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by slicing your tomatos, onions, and lettuce to prep for the burger(s). </li>
            <li>Mix a table spoon of ketchup, mustard, and mayo to create the spread for the burger.</li>
            <li>Once the first two steps have been finished, heat up a pan on the low-end of medium head and add a tablespoon of  your preferred vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Once the pain is ready, grab your beef patty and place gently on the pan. While the meat is cooking, add some of <strong>The Blend</strong> seasoning  and some <strong>mustard</strong> to the top side of the patty.</li>
            <li>As soon as the patty starts to look a bit sweaty from the top, flip over the patty and you can add a little more seasoning to this side as well.</li>
            <li>Once the meat looks cooked to your liking, you can add American cheese to the patty and cover the pan for about 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
            <li>While the meat cooks, you can go ahead and toast the bread as well.</li>
            <li>Then, place your toasted buns on a plate and add the sauce, lettuce, tomatos, and onions to the top half of the bun.</li>
            <li>Finally, add the cooked patty to the bottom bun and voila! You cooked yourself a delicious burger!</li>
