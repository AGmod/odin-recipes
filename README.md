# odin-recipes

This project is a start to get myself adjusted on the foundations of working with html by creating simple recipe webpages.

This also helped review on using Git commands from the terminal, while also practicing on making proper commit comments.

I used link elements and image elements in each recipe page since they are essential for many modern websipes.
